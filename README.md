Community Multiscale Air Quality Model version 5.1 (November 2015)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Atmospheric Science Modeling Division 
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations. 
CMAQ is supported and distributed by the CMAS Center.

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor 
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone, 
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model version 5.1 is major update to CMAQ that includes 
several changes to the science algorithms in the base model. CMAQ v5.1 was developed by the U.S. EPA with 
contributions from other research partners. CMAQv5.1 builds upon the beta version made available to the 
modeling community in April 2015 by the U.S. EPA. Summarized below are the main enhancements to the 
modeling system since the previous release, CMAQ v5.0.2.
